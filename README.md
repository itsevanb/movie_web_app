# Movie Web App

## Overview

This web application allows users to manage a list of their favorite movies. It's built using Flask for the backend, with Jinja2 for templating, and HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript for the frontend. Data is managed through a custom Python class and stored persistently in a JSON file.

## Core Functionalities

1. **User Selection**: Users can select their profile to view and manage their favorite movies list.

2. **Movie Management**: After a user is selected, the app will display a list of their favorite movies. From this list, users are able to perform the following operations:
    - Add a new movie to their list
    - Delete a movie from their list
    - Update the details of a movie in their list
    - List all movies in their list
